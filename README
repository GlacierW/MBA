Malware Behavior Analyzer, MBA

MBA is a QEMU-based, sandbox system dedicated to malware analysis for Windows x64
Currently, MBA supports the following features:

    1. De-coupled Information Flow Tracking (DIFT)
       It is also known as taint analysis.
       Leveraging the DIFT feature, the contamination 
       conducted by malware to the guest OS can be identified.

       We would like to thank Chi-Wei, Wang, who developed the 
       initial version of DIFT, for sharing his source code. The
       original DIFT is mainly for x86 platform. In this project,
       the DIFT is upgraded to support modern x86_64 platform.

       Information Flow Tracking and its Optimizations," Journal of
